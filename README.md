Ramayan, also known as Ramanand Sagar's Ramayan, is an iconic Indian Hindi-language epic television series that originally aired on DD National between 1987 and 1988. Created, written, and directed by Ramanand Sagar, the series is based on the ancient Indian Sanskrit epic, the Ramayana. The show was narrated by the legendary Ashok Kumar and Ramanand Sagar himself, with music composed by Ravindra Jain.

During its initial run, Ramayan became the most-watched television series in the world, boasting an incredible 82% viewership. Its success extended far beyond India, with repeat broadcasts aired on 20 different channels across 17 countries on all five continents. According to the BBC, the series has been viewed by over 650 million people globally. Each episode earned DD National a revenue of ₹40 lakh, making it a highly profitable production.

The series primarily draws from Valmiki's Ramayan and Tulsidas' Ramcharitmanas, while also incorporating elements from various regional versions of the Ramayan, including Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Urdu adaptations. With a budget of ₹9 lakhs per episode, it was the most expensive TV show produced in India at the time.

The cultural impact of Ramayan was profound. On Sundays, when the series was aired, streets would empty, shops would close, and people would perform rituals such as bathing and garlanding their television sets in reverence before the show began. The series was re-aired during the 2020 coronavirus lockdown, where it once again captured global attention, setting a new record with 77 million viewers on 16 April 2020, making it the most-watched TV show in the world at that time.
